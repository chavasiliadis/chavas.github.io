# mel-project

## Description

My motivation to build this architecture-company website was the fact that I would be able to implement my skills and create a fully-functional single-page-application dynamic website using mainly REACT. Through my effort I was able to gain an understanding of basic elements and combine **npm-packages** with **React** in a more *meaninful* way. After all, I gained a spot in the 'About' page of their company (and hopefully in their heart), and I am open for new challenges and projects!

Have a look in the deployed version: [link to the company's website](https://www.fzin.it/)
